##Where Am I - Summary of Tasks

In this project, you will learn to utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments.

Over the course of this lesson, you will learn several aspects of robotic software engineering with a focus on ROS:
* Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world
* Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot
* Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results

##Native Installation

If you are working with a native ROS installation or using a VM, some of the following package might need to be installed. You could install them as shown below:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-map-server
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-move-base
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-amcl
```
